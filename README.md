# SnowflakeEditor

## Introduction
Recently, I have read about the Snowflake method for writing. More information on the writing method [here](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/).
I have found functional software, both paid and free, for this writing method online. 

As a developer, I am more interested in developing my version of the software than actually using it. Therefore, I will be creating my own interface in the repository. Updates will be irregular, but development will continue until stated otherwise.
